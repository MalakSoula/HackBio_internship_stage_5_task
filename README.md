# Classification of Clinical Stage Liver Cancer

This project combines **machine learning** and **biomarker design** to classify the stages of liver cancer. The objective is to enhance accuracy in stage classification by analyzing gene expression and methylation data.

## Background

According to the American Cancer Society (ACS), liver cancer has four stages, determined by factors such as tumor size, spread to lymph nodes, and metastasis. However, few studies classify these stages using gene expressions and methylation data. 

This project aims to fill that gap by:
1. Collecting relevant research papers from the past five years.
2. Gathering liver cancer patient data from TCGA.
3. Preprocessing and cleaning the data.
4. Using machine learning algorithms and biomarker analysis to improve classification accuracy.

## Methodology

1. **Data Collection**: Accumulation of recent research and patient data.
2. **Preprocessing**: Cleaning and organizing the dataset for analysis.
3. **Biomarker Identification**: Identifying pathways and significant genes.
4. **Machine Learning**: Applying clustering and classification models to classify liver cancer stages.

## Tools and Technologies
- Python
- Machine Learning Algorithms (e.g., K-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest)
- Biomarker Discovery Techniques

## Expected Results

- Identification of new liver cancer biomarkers.
- Development of efficient ML models to classify liver cancer stages.
- Integration of biomarker discovery and machine learning for enhanced accuracy.
